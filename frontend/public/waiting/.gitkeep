# Waiting Audio Files

Place the following audio files here (matching backend WAITING_PHRASES):

- 0.mp3: "ちょっと待ってね"
- 1.mp3: "えーっと、ちょっと待って"
- 2.mp3: "うーんと、待ってね"
- 3.mp3: "少し待ってね"

These files are played by the frontend when the backend sends a "waiting" event
with a phraseIndex. This saves bandwidth by not streaming audio from the server.
